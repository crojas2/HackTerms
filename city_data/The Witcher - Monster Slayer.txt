Overview: 

1. These are legally binding rules for The Witcher: Monster Slayer (TWMS) and related products.
You are given a personal, limited right to access and play TWMS (but SPOKKO owns TWMS).
There are rules regarding what you can/cannot do with TWMS (e.g. be safe, don’t cheat, be nice, don’t spoil the enjoyment of others).
Depending on where you live, there are important rules regarding liability and dispute resolution (including mandatory arbitration and waiver of jury trial if you live in the USA).
SPOKKO’s Privacy Policy explains what information is collected to provide you with access to TWMS and how it’s protected. Our Fan Content Guidelines explain what stuff you can make regarding TWMS (e.g. fan art, community sites).

OK, that’s done. Hello! We are SPOKKO and we are part of CD PROJEKT Capital Group. We have created these TWMS Terms of Service (or “Agreement” for short) to explain what you can (and cannot) do with TWMS. We put it together as simply as we legally can, with some informal short summaries to help you understand what it means. However, the full text wording is what is important/binding legally.
